PHP-DBus bindings
=================
The author of this extension is Derick Rethans.
I've just moved it from PECL to github, because occured some problems
installing it as a PEAR and SVN type dependency.

This is version 0.1.1, as package.xml from PEAR states.

Installation
-----------
phpize
make
make install

Notes
-----
My other project contains some stub class for code completion (if you use PhpStorm, NetBeans, or whatever supports @method annotation)
